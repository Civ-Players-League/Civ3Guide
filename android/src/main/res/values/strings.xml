    <string name="combat_odds_first_time_explanation">This game tests your ability to estimate whether it\&apos;s worth it to attack a particular unit, based on 1) the probability of victory, and 2) the shield costs of the fighting units.\n\nThe favourability of the exchange is measured as Expected Shields, or ES, a measure of how many shields you expect to gain or lose from the exchange on average, compared to your enemy. A positive ES is good for you, a negative ES is bad.</string>
